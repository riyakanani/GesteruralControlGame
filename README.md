<h3>My Contributions </h3>
<p> I created the genesis script which can be found at "GesteruralControlGame/Assets/MediaPipeUnity/Samples/Scenes/Hand Tracking
/Genesis.cs". </p>

<p> Additionally, I fully scripted an oscillator script: "GesteruralControlGame/Assets/MediaPipeUnity/Samples/Scenes/Hand Tracking
/Oscillator.cs". </p>

<p> Furthermore, I created a script to detect collision between hand movement and the oscillating balls: "GesteruralControlGame/Assets/MediaPipeUnity/Samples/Scenes/Hand Tracking
/Collision.cs" </p>

<p> Lastly, under "GesteruralControlGame/Assets/MediaPipeUnity/Samples/Scenes/Hand Tracking
/HandTrackingSolution.cs", I created the OnHandLandmarksOutput() method. </p>
